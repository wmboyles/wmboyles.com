<!-- Personal Website -->

<p class="lead">
    I created wmboyles.com as a place to provide more in-depth information about
    me and my projects than can fit onto a resume. The first version of the
    website was done in pure HTML with no tools or frameworks. This was
    intentional so that I'd become deeply familiar with how the website was
    structured and not becomes reliant on tools that I didn't fully understand.

<h4 class="text-uppercase text-black">Bootstrap</h4>
<p class="lead">
    In the second iteration of the site, I started using
    <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap </a>. This
    gave the website the general "look" that it still has today. It also made
    the website much friendlier to mobile devices and varying screen sizes. I
    was also able to add in some neat features, like a collapsible navbar. I
    still use Bootstrap across the site today to do the vast majority of the
    styling.

<h4 class="text-uppercase text-black">Jekyll</h4>
<p class="lead">
    Prior to the third (and current) iteration of the site, I was becoming
    increasingly frustrated when I needed to make small changes, like fixing a
    link in the navbar. I'd have to manually go and correct the link on each
    page the navbar appeared. This lead to lots of time wasted and lots of
    redundant code that was open to mistakes. To remedy this, I use
    <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to generate the site for me.
    Jekyll's template and include features allow me to only have the information
    that is unique to each page in a file, while common elements exist in their
    own files.This approach allows me to have just one file I need to change
    when updating the navbar, which means fewer opportunities for mistakes.
</p>

<h4 class="text-uppercase text-black">Deployment</h4>
<p class="lead">
    I've used basically the same deployment tools through all iterations of the
    site. I have had a Google domain that costs $12/yr. The static site uses
    GitHub Pages, which works well with Jekyll. Although this approach has some
    limitations that come with a static site, it is extremely cost-effective and
    meets my needs. It also gives some nice features. For example, it takes
    maximum 2 minutes for a change I push to GitHub to be live and viewable.

<p class="lead">
    Although you are already viewing the website, all the code is available on
    <a href="https://github.com/wmboyles/wmboyles.com">GitHub</a>.
