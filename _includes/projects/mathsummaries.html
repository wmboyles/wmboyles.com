    While taking a summer physics class dealing with multivariable calculus, I
    realized how much of the subject I had already forgotten even though I took
    a multivariable calculus class (Calc III) only nine months earlier. I also
    knew that several of my friends who would be taking Calc III in the coming
    semesters, and they had already requested my notes from and help with the
    class.

    However, my hurriedly-taken handwritten notes could be sometimes incomplete
    and hard to read. Plus, I like to keep my handwritten notes as a reference.
    I decided to digitize my notes using
    <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/" target="_blank">LaTeX</a>
    in an abridged textbook structure. I would also add better visual aids than
    the sketches in my notes. This way, I could easily share clear and legible
    notes with my friends, keep the original notes for myself, and refresh my
    own understanding while writing. By the time I was finished, I had condensed
    a several thousand page textbook into an 81 page document that covered all
    the important topics mentioned in class while still containing many visual
    aids, examples, full length proofs, and test questions.

    After completing my notes, I posted the results to
    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/math/" target="_blank">r/math</a>, an
    online community of math enthusiasts of all levels. To my surprise, my post
    was incredibly well-received. Several users suggested I make my work open
    source so that others could help make corrections and suggest additions.

    has already taken several community contributions.

    Since then, I've begun expanding the scope of the project beyond
    multivaraible calculus. The project now includes summaries of intro to
    differential equations, usually the next class after Calc III, and single
    variable calculus, which covers both Calc I and II.

    It has been incredibly heartwarming to see how many people appreciate my
    work and take enough interest to point out mistakes, make suggestions, and
    contribute. I hope to continue expanding this project as I take more math
    classes. I expect linear algebra to be the next topic I'll cover.
