  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <hr />
  <p>
    Hi, I'm William Boyles. I'm a computer science> and mathematics double major
    at North Carolina State University, graduating in May 2022. I'm originally
    from Winston-Salem, North Carolina. When I'm not busy with my school work,
    you might find me working on some of my own projects, like an app to predict
    air quality, an open source project to summarize various math subjects, or
    even this website. If I'm not writing code or doing math, you might find me
    solving Rubik's Cubes, playing ping-pong, cooking a new dish, traveling with
    friends and family, or binging a comedy on Netflix.
  </p>

    During summer 2020, I worked at IBM as a Cloud and Cognitive Software
    Intern. I built a Python bot that analyzed and reported cloud outage over
    Slack. During summer 2021, I worked at Microsoft as a Software Engineering
    Intern. I built an Azure Data Factory pipeline that would report sales
    mismatches to an incident management system. I'm excited to be returning to
    Microsoft full-time after after graduation.
