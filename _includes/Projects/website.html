          I created wmboyles.com as a place to provide more in-depth information
          about me and my projects than can fit onto a resume. Coding the
          website and buying a domain name were great learning experiences. The
          first iteration of the website was in vanilla HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript. I wanted to get the experience of doing everything myself
          rather than using no-code site builder tools. This version was
          passable, but it didn't look good on mobile devices with narrower
          screens. To solve this in my next iteration, I used
          <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap </a> to
          do cleaner styling and work better on mobile devices. This version
          worked well, but I was annoyed that some files were very long and
          redundant. Often, if I wanted to make a small change, I would have to
          make it on every single page. To alleviate this in my third and
          current iterations, I now use Jekyll to generate my site for me. Now,
          I can write redundant peices of code once and just include them where
          needed.
