          <em>Jeopardy!</em> has for a long time been one of my favorite TV game
          shows. I enjoy how the game is mostly skill-based and I always learn
          something new when I play along. When I heard about the free
          <a href="https://jservice.io/" target="_blank">JService</a> API from a
          friend, I thought this would be a fun opportunity for me to learn
          about interacting with APIs.

          I decided to write a single-player version of the game that could be
          used for practicing. I went with JavaScript running in the client's
          web-browser, as this would allow me to deploy my app for free as a
          website hosted by GitHub Pages. After I figured out how to make calls
          to the JService API, the rest of the implementation was fairly
          straitforward.

          The biggest issue came from some unavoidable problems with the
          JService API. For API problems, some <em>Jeopardy!</em> clues use
          sounds or videos as clues, the gimmick of certain categories are also
          hard to understand without an explination from the host. JService
          provides access to neither of these things. Although JService has made
          an effort to remove these sorts of clues from its dataset, some still
          remain. Further, the answers to certain clues sometimes contain
          extraneous words like "a" or "the". To avoid the user being penalized
          for responses that arent't letter for letter perfect, I've included an
          "I'm Right" button that gives the user credit for an answer that
          doesn't exactly match the one provided by JService. Another big
          difference between traditional <em>Jeopardy!</em> gameplay and mine is
          that I don't require users to answer in the form of a question. This
          matched the form in which answers were sent by the API.
