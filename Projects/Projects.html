				<h2>Lights Out Android App</h2>
				<p class="tabbedP">My Lights Out app is based on the 1995
					handheld electronic game by Tiger Electronics of the same name. In
					the 1995 version, the game board consists of a 5x5 grid of lights,
					and then when game starts, a seemingly random pattern of lights is
					presented to the player. The player's objective is to toggle lights
					to turn all of the lights off with button presses, preferably in as
					few presses as possible.</p>

				<p class="tabbedP">When a light is pressed, the on/off state of
					the pressed light and all directly adjacent lights are toggled.</p>

				<div class="centeredImg">
					<img
						src="../Images/Projects/Java/toggle1.jpg"
						alt="A board before a button press"
					> <img
						src="../Images/Projects/Java/toggle2.jpg"
						alt="A board after a button press"
					>
				</div>

				<p class="tabbedP">Although similar handheld games and apps
					already exists. There are two things that I belive make my app
					unique: variable board sizes, and mathematical optimization.</p>

				<h3>Variable Board Sizes</h3>
				<p class="tabbedP">
					Many of the apps availiable today only feature a single board size,
					usually the classic 5x5. This makes the app less challenging once
					the user finds a reliable method for solving the single board size
					and limits the number of possible scrambles. For the 5x5 board,
					there are 2<sup>23</sup>=8388608 distinct ways to create a
					scramble. However, there are at least 4 different ways to create
					any given scramble, leaving at most 2<sup>19</sup>=524288 unique
					scrambles. All of these scrambles can be solved in at most 15
					button presses.
				</p>

				<p class="tabbedP">My app allows user to play any board size
					from the trivial 1x1 to the daunting 10x10, providing orders of
					magnitude more unique scrambles than the 5x5 alone. I would have
					allowed even larges sizes, but the buttons were getting too small
					to reliably press.</p>
				<div class="centeredImg">
					<img
						src="../Images/Projects/Java/levelSelect.jpg"
						alt="Level selection"
					> <img
						src="../Images/Projects/Java/10X10.jpg"
						alt="A scrambled 10x10 board"
					>
				</div>
				<p class="tabbedP">
					In fact, just the 10x10 size has 2<sup>100</sup>, over 1 nonillion
					unique scrambles. For comparision, if each unique board were
					printed on a sheet of paper .1mm thick, the stack of paper would
					reach to the edge of the observable universe 13.4 billion light
					years away.
				</p>

				<p class="tabbedP">User have yet another dimension opened to
					them in being able to play by only pressing buttons that are
					already on. Although all puzzles that can be solved normally can
					also be solved by only pressing on buttons, it makes for a much
					more difficult challenge because the way that most learn to solve
					the 5x5 board requires pressing off buttons.</p>

				<h3>Mathematical Optimization</h3>
				<p class="tabbedP">
					I already mentioned how any 5x5 board can be solved in at most 15
					button presses. Puzzle enthuiasts and recreational mathematicians
					like Jaap Scherphuis proved this to be the case. Jaap in particular
					uses a method of treating solving the board as a linear algebra
					problem that is described by mathematician Marlow Anderson and Todd
					Feil in their 1998 paper <i>Turning Lights Out with Linear
						Algebra</i>.
				</p>

				<p class="tabbedP">I implemented Andserson and Feil's method of
					row-reducing matricies modulo 2 to determine the minimum number of
					clicks needed to solve any given board. This way users can know how
					their solve is compared to the absolute best they could do.</p>
				<img
					src="../Images/Projects/Java/10x10.jpg"
					alt="The minimum for this 10x10 board is 42 clicks"
					style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-height: 25em;"
				>

				<p class="tabbedP">Although this value is only one on a screen,
					I think it provides valuable information to users about a given
					puzzle's difficults and their own solving abilities that no other
					app has.</p>

				<p class="tabbedP">
					Although all of the features I talked about are already
					implemented, I am still developing the app using Java in Android
					Studio. In the meantime, you can play an <a
						href="../LightsOut/lightsOut.html"
					>online version</a> that doesn't have the minimum clicks implemented
					that I created using JavaScript.

					<span class="project_language">Python</span>

			<div class="coll_content">
				<h2>Computer Vision Security Camera</h2>
				<p class="tabbedP">This application started when my high-school
					engineering class had just moved into a larger building. It was
					common for expensive tools to get lost or stolen, so we needed a
					way to find these items and identify any culprits.</p>
				<p class="tabbedP">Although the new building already had some
					installed security cameras, there were still many blind spots, and
					footage could only be saved up to one week, meaning that if a tool
					were discovered missing after one week had passed, the traditional
					security cameras would not be useful in recovering it. My solution
					was to use Raspberry Pi's, which are small, cheap, and single-board
					computers, as "smart"" security cameras. These devices would be
					cheaper and easier to install than traditional cameras, and they
					could be more easily moved to another location if needed.</p>
				<p class="tabbedP">My first goal was to cut down on the storage
					space needed for footage without sacrificing picture quality or
					other valuable information. My solution was for the smart cameras
					to record video only when they detect motion. This way, disk space
					wouldn't be wasted on recording hours of the exact scene, but would
					still catch thieves as they walked into view.</p>
				<p class="tabbedP">
					This method worked extremely well. In many cases, hours of video
					was cut down to mere minutes. However, changing lighting conditions
					throughout the day could add noise to the image that would be
					mistaken for motion. I decided to fix this problem by having a
					threshold for motion that could be calibrated and changed
					automatically throughout the day. However, I wanted to make sure
					thieves would still be recorded, regardless of the lighting
					conditions. This is where computer vision came to my aid. Using
					Python's <a href="https://opencv.org">OpenCV</a> library, I
					searched the video feed for faces. If any faces were detected, a
					green rectangle would be drawn around the face in the video feed,
					an image of the frame containing the face would be saved, and the
					camera would wait to recalibrate until no faces were detected.
				</p>
				<p class="tabbedP">
					Taken from the camera's results is an image below of me walking
					through the frame, the camera has seen my face and is recording
					video. <img

				<h2>Multivariable Calculus Summary</h2>
				<p class="tabbedP">While taking a summer physics class dealing
					with Maxwell's Equations, which are written in the language of
					multivariable calculus, I realized how much of the subject I had
					forgotten, despite taking a multivariable calculus class (Calc III)
					only nine months earlier. I also knew that several of my friends
					who would be taking Calc III in the coming semester had already
					requested my advice about the class or to look at my handwritten
					notes, but I like to have my notes as a reference.</p>
				<p class="tabbedP">
					I decided to digitize my notes using <a
						href="https://www.latex-project.org/"
					>LaTeX</a> in a textbook structure: chapters with sections and
					sub-sections. I would also add better visual aids than my
					hurriedly-made sketches using images from textbooks and other
					online resources. This way, I could more easily share clear,
					legible notes, keep the original, and refresh my understanding in
					the process. By the time I was finished, I had condensed the
					several-thousand page textbook into an <a
						href="../Documents/Projects/MA242_Summary.pdf"
						target="_blank"
					>81-page guide</a> that still contained scores of visual aids and
					many full-length proofs. I feel much more confident in my
					abilities, and I think my friends will be able to learn from me
					much more easily.
				</p>
				<p class="tabbedP">
					After completing my notes, I posted the results to <a
						href="https://www.reddit.com/r/math/"
					>r/math</a>, an online community of math enthusiasts. To my surprise,
					<a
						href="https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/crfqhz/i_made_a_shortish_summary_of_multivariable/"
					>my post</a> was incredibly well-received. Several users suggested
					open-sourcing my work so that they and others in the community
					could make corrections and suggest additions.
				</p>
				<p class="tabbedP">
					So, I spent much of the next two weeks converting my
					GoogleDoc-LaTeX hybrid into a pure LaTeX document. <a
						href="https://github.com/wmboyles/Calc3-Summary"
					>The repo</a> is available and has already taken several

				<h2>Twitter Bad Words Count Bot</h2>
				<p class="tabbedP">The language that people choose to use can

					mutual respect between two parties is that neither resorts to

				<p class="tabbedP">
					I wrote the bot in Python, following basic online video tutorials
					that detailed how to work with the Twitter API through the python
					library <a href="https://www.tweepy.org/">tweepy</a>. Although
					these tutorials showed me how to detect when a user had @ mentioned
					the bot and how to respond to tweets, the real challenge and
					substance of this bot came from accesing another user's tweets,
					parsing through them to find bad words, and reporting the frequency
					of these bad words within the 280-character limit of a Tweet.
				</p>


				<p class="tabbedP">
					After finding seperate answers on how to access a given user's
					tweets, I got to work on detecting bad words. Although I found
					several GitHub repos that contained lists of bad words, many were
					too comprehensive, marking even words with possible negative
					connotationsm, like the names of political parties, as bad. I
					eventually settled on a <a
						href="https://github.com/RobertJGabriel/Google-profanity-words"
					>list</a> of 444 common words collected by Google. This list was
					comprehensive enough to cover most bad word, and even common
					variations like swapping a letter for a number. On the
					implementation side, I took advantage of Python's built-in
					dictionary functionality to find matching bad words in a user's 100
					most recent tweets and rank them by frequency.
				</p>

				<p class="tabbedP">
					For deployment, I settled on a free service reccomended in one of
					the simple video tutorials, <a
						href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com"
					>PythonAnywhere</a>. I know that this solution is probably not best
					practice, but I struggled with trying to use other platforms like <a
						href="https://www.heroku.com"
					>Heroku</a> because I could not work out compatability issues or find
					documentation detailed enough to fix issues.
				</p>

				<p class="tabbedP">
					The bot's Twitter handle is <a

				<h2>Linear Algebra Library</h2>
				<p class="tabbedP">I originally started working on this project
					in high school to practice array manipulation in preparation for
					the AP Computer Science A exam. My main goal at that point was to
					be able to find the reduced-row echelon form of a given array of
					doubles, allowing me to solve linear systems of equations.</p>
				<p class="tabbedP">As my knowledge grew regarding
					object-oriented programming and the applications of matrices to
					structures like networks, so did this project. I added a "Vector"
					class where one could determine vector information (e.g.,
					cross-product and dot-product) or use these Vectors to populate a
					Matrix. One major change I made was making the "Matrix" class
					generically-typed, with "BinaryMatrix" and "NumericMatrix"
					extending the Matrix class and adding additional data type-specific
					functionality. For example, a specific application of the
					BinaryMatrix class is the ability to represent and determine
					qualities (e.g., reflexive, transitive, trichotomous) of binary
					relations; the DoubleMatrix class can solve linear systems of
					equations like originally intended.</p>
				<p class="tabbedP">I also learned the importance of unit testing
					and code coverage. Currently, all fully-implemented classes have
					100% method coverage, at least 90% line coverage, and all tests
					passing. I will continue to add more unit tests and maintain high
					coverage as I implement greater functionality.</p>
				<p class="tabbedP">
					Below is a recent coverage report. All concrete classes, except
					those in the graph package and NumericMatrix, have more than 95%
					line coverage. Classes in the graph package are not yet ready for a
					round of testing, and NumericMatrix may soon be deleted, depending
					on whether this library will support matrices of non-numerical
					values. <img
						class="collTitleImg"
						src="../Images/Projects/Java/LinAlg_Coverage.PNG"
						alt="Eclipse coverage report of Linear Alebra library"
					>
				</p>
				<p class="tabbedP">In the future, I want to continue adding
					functionality for important objects in mathematics and computer
					science that are commonly represented as matrices. This includes
					items like Markov Chains and graphs. I am especially excited about
					developing weighted and directed graphs (digraphs) for applications
					like pathfinding and optimization.</p>

				<p class="tabbedP">
					Visuals have always been an effective and fun way for me to learn,
					especially when the topic is abstract. The <a

					Python GUI libraries allow for simple image manipulation, down to
					the pixel level.
				</p>

				<p class="tabbedP">For example, the left image below visualizes
					how numbers change after a given number of iterations in the
					unsolved Collatz conjecture; it has been my phone background for
					several years. For a more artistic visualization, see the right
					image below, which applies a smeared watercolor effect.</p>

				<p class="tabbedP">The Turtle library allows one to trace out

					curve, shown below.</p>

					Fern, pine branch and piece of tall grass. The procedural
					generation techniques used to create these images, known as
