				<div class="row">
					<div class="col">
						<p class="lead">My Lights Out app is based on the 1995 handheld
							electronic game by Tiger Electronics of the same name. In the 1995
							version, the game board consists of a 5x5 grid of lights, and then
							when game starts, a seemingly random pattern of lights is
							presented to the player. The player's objective is to toggle
							lights to turn all the lights off with button presses,
							preferably in as few presses as possible.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col">
						<p class="lead">When a light is pressed, the on/off state of
							the pressed light and all directly adjacent lights are toggled.</p>

					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col">
						<p class="lead">Although similar handheld games and apps
							already exists. There are two things that I believe make my app
							unique: variable board sizes, and mathematical optimization.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<h4 class="page-subsection-heading text-uppercase text-black">Variable
					Board Sizes</h4>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col">
						<p class="lead">
							Many of the apps available today only feature a single board
							size, usually the classic 5x5. This makes the app less challenging
							once the user finds a reliable method for solving the single board
							size and limits the number of possible scrambles. For the 5x5
							board, there are 2<sup>23</sup>=8388608 distinct ways to create a
							scramble. However, there are at least 4 different ways to create
							any given scramble, leaving at most 2<sup>19</sup>=524288 unique
							scrambles. All of these scrambles can be solved in at most 15
							button presses.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col">
						<p class="lead">My app allows user to play any board size from
							the trivial 1x1 to the daunting 10x10, providing orders of
							magnitude more unique scrambles than the 5x5 alone. I would have
							allowed even larges sizes, but the buttons were getting too small
							to reliably press.</p>

				<div class="row">
					<div class="col">
						<p class="lead">
							In fact, just the 10x10 size has 2<sup>100</sup>, over 1 nonillion
							unique scrambles. For comparison, if each unique board were
							printed on a sheet of paper 0.1 mm thick, the stack of paper would
							reach to the edge of the observable universe 13.4 billion light
							years away.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col">
						<p class="lead">Users have yet another dimension opened to them
							in being able to play by only pressing buttons that are already
							on. Although all puzzles that can be solved normally can also be
							solved by only pressing on buttons, it makes for a much more
							difficult challenge because the way that most learn to solve the
							5x5 board requires pressing off buttons.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<h4 class="page-subsection-heading text-uppercase text-black">Mathematical
					Optimization</h4>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col">
						<p class="lead">
							I already mentioned how any 5x5 board can be solved in at most 15
							button presses. Puzzle enthusiasts and recreational mathematicians
							like Jaap Scherphuis proved this to be the case. Jaap in
							particular uses a method of treating solving the board as a linear
							algebra problem that is described by mathematician Marlow Anderson
							and Todd Feil in their 1998 paper <em>Turning Lights Out with
								Linear Algebra</em>.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col">
						<p class="lead">I implemented Andserson and Feil's method of
							row-reducing matrices modulo 2 to determine the minimum number of
							clicks needed to solve any given board. This way users can know

				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col">
						<p class="lead">Although this value is only one number on a screen, I

					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col">
						<p class="lead">
							The app is currently available for free download on the Google

				</h2>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col">
						<p class="lead">This application started when my high-school
							engineering class had just moved into a larger building. It was
							common for expensive tools to get lost or stolen, so we needed a
							way to find these items and identify any culprits.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col">
						<p class="lead">Although the new building already had some
							installed security cameras, there were still many blind spots, and
							footage could only be saved up to one week, meaning that if a tool
							were discovered missing after one week had passed, the traditional
							security cameras would not be useful in recovering it. My solution
							was to use Raspberry Pi's, which are small, cheap, and
							single-board computers, as "smart" security cameras. These devices
							would be cheaper and easier to install than traditional cameras,
							and they could be more easily moved to another location if needed.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col">
						<p class="lead">My first goal was to cut down on the storage
							space needed for footage without sacrificing picture quality or
							other valuable information. My solution was for the smart cameras
							to record video only when they detect motion. This way, disk space
							wouldn't be wasted on recording hours of the exact scene, but
							would still catch thieves as they walked into view.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col">
						<p class="lead">
							This method worked extremely well. In many cases, hours of video
							was cut down to mere minutes. However, changing lighting
							conditions throughout the day could add noise to the image that
							would be mistaken for motion. I decided to fix this problem by
							having a threshold for motion that could be calibrated and changed
							automatically throughout the day. However, I wanted to make sure
							thieves would still be recorded, regardless of the lighting
							conditions. This is where computer vision came to my aid. Using
							Python's <a href="https://opencv.org/" target="_blank">OpenCV</a> library, I searched the
							video feed for faces. If any
							faces were detected, a green rectangle would be drawn around the
							face in the video feed, an image of the frame containing the face
							would be saved, and the camera would wait to recalibrate until no
							faces were detected.

							programming and the applications of matrices to structures like
							networks, so did this project. I added a "Vector" class where one
							could determine vector information (e.g., cross-product and
							dot-product) or use these Vectors to populate a Matrix. One major
							change I made was making the "Matrix" class generically-typed,
							with "BinaryMatrix" and "NumericMatrix" extending the Matrix class
							and adding additional data type-specific functionality. For
							example, a specific application of the BinaryMatrix class is the
							ability to represent and determine qualities (e.g., reflexive,
							transitive, trichotomous) of binary relations; the DoubleMatrix
							class can solve linear systems of equations like originally
							intended.</p>

						<p class="lead">I also learned the importance of unit testing
							and code coverage. Currently, all fully-implemented classes have
							100% method coverage, at least 90% line coverage, and all tests
							passing. I will continue to add more unit tests and maintain high
							coverage as I implement greater functionality.</p>

				<div class="row">
					<div class="col">
						<p class="lead">Below is a recent coverage report. All concrete
							classes, except those in the graph package and NumericMatrix, have
							more than 95% line coverage. Classes in the graph package are not
							yet ready for a round of testing, and NumericMatrix may soon be
							deleted, depending on whether this library will support matrices
							of non-numerical values.</p>
