				<h2>Linear Algebra Library</h2>
				<p class="tabbedP">I originally started working on this project
					in highschool to practice array manipulation in preparation for the
					AP Computer Science A exam. My main goal at that point was to be
					able to find the reduced-row echelon form of a given array of
					doubles, allowing me to solve linear systems of equations.</p>
				<p class="tabbedP">As my knowledge grew regarding
					object-oriented programming and the applications of matrices to
					structures like networks, so did this project. I added a "Vector"
					class where one could determine vector information (e.g.,
					cross-product and dot-product) or use these Vectors to populate a
					Matrix. One major change I made was making the "Matrix" class
					generically-typed, with "BinaryMatrix" and "NumericMatrix"
					extending the Matrix class and adding additional data type-specific
					functionality. For example, a specific application of the
					BinaryMatrix class is the ability to represent and determine
					qualities (e.g., reflexive, transitive, trichotomous) of binary
					relations; the DoubleMatrix class can solve linear systems of
					equations like originally intended.</p>
				<p class="tabbedP">I also learned the importance of unit testing
					and code coverage. Currently, all fully-implemented classes have
					100% method coverage, at least 90% line coverage, and all tests
					passing. I will continue to add more unit tests and maintain high
					coverage as I implement greater functionality.</p>
				<p class="tabbedP">
					Below is a recent coverage report. All concrete classes, except
					those in the graph package and NumericMatrix, have more than 95%
					line coverage. Classes in the graph package are not yet ready for a
					round of testing, and NumericMatrix may soon be deleted, depending
					on whether this library will support matrices of non-numerical
					values. <img
						class="collTitleImg"

					>
				</p>
				<p class="tabbedP">In the future, I want to continue adding
					functionality for important objects in mathematics and computer
					science that are commonly represented as matrices. This includes
					items like Markov Chains and graphs. I am especially excited about
					developing weighted and directed graphs (digraphs) for applications
					like pathfinding and optimization.</p>

				<h2>Rubik's Cube Solver</h2>
				<p class="tabbedP">One of my favorite hobbies is solving Rubik's
					Cubes and other twisty puzzles (a.k.a. cubing). I started by
					learning how to solve the 3x3x3 (Classic), which I can now solve in
					less than one minute. My collection of twisty puzzles has since
					grown to also include a 2x2x2 (Mini), 4x4x4 (Rubik's Revenge), a
					5x5x5 (Professor's Cube), a tetrahedral puzzle (Pyraminx), and a
					dodecahedral puzzle (Megaminx), shown below.</p>
				<div class="imgCollage">
					<div class="collageRow">
						<img
							class="collageCol2"
							src="../Images/Projects/Java/2345.jfif"
						> <img
							class="collageCol2"
							src="../Images/Projects/Java/pyraminx.jpg"
						> <img
							class="collageCol2"
							src="../Images/Projects/Java/megaminx.jpg"
						>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p class="tabbedP">I decided to combine my hobbies of cubing and
					Java programming into a program that would represent, manipulate,
					and solve virtual twisty puzzles. Currently, the project can only
					represent and manipulate 3x3x3 and 2x2x2 puzzles, but due to the
					object-oriented structure of the project, support for larger cubes
					could readily be added. I am focusing on writing a solving
					algorithm for the 3x3x3. Although the 2x2x2 may seem like a better
					place to start working because it is smaller and easier to solve
					than the 3x3x3, the solving method used by humans to solve the
					3x3x3 applies more generally to larger cubes.</p>
				<p class="tabbedP">Right now, my 3x3x3 algorithm can complete
					any solvable 3x3x3 cube where the first two layers are already
					finished. These final two steps are known to cubers (Rubik's Cube
					solvers) as OLL (orient last layer) and PLL (permute last layer). I
					am having trouble adding previous steps due to the sheer number of
					different possibilities in completing these steps. For example, the
					first step in most Rubik's Cube solving strategies is to properly
					align the four edge pieces on the bottom face, which creates a
					cross shape. Although this is a relatively simple task, it's
					difficult to properly account for every case in an efficient way
					because aligning one edge could undo previous work. I may need to
					re-evaluate my solving strategy to make it more
					programming-friendly.</p>
				<p class="tabbedP">After I successfully complete the 3x3x3
					solving method, I plan to work on other sizes. Larger-sized cubes
					can have an additional step after OLL and PLL called "parity" that
					can happen due to edges being more than one cube-unit (cubie).
					Having worked on solving algorithms for at least the Mini, Classic,
					and Revenge puzzles, I want to create a visual user-interface,
					where users can solve various-sized cubes for themselves. Given how
					visual the process of solving a Rubik's Cube is, for beginners and
					experts alike, this is an important step in making a mature,
					enjoyable piece of software.</p>

				<h2>Personal Website</h2>
				<p class="tabbedP">
					I created <a
						class="myDomain"
						href="../Index/index.html"
					>INSERT DOMAIN HERE</a> because I felt that my front-end development
					skills were lacking. Front-end development is taught (if at all) in
					most computer science curriculums as an afterthought. However, I
					believe that just as students are taught to make clean, legible,
					and well-documented code through comments and programming paradigms
					(like object-oriented), they should also be taught how to make
					clean, navigable, and intuitive front ends. After all, this is the
					portion of a product with which most end-users will interact.
				</p>
				<p class="tabbedP">
					<a
						class="myDomain"
						href="..Index/index.html"
					>INSERT DOMAIN HERE</a> is meant to meet these design criteria and to
					be a place to talk about myself and my experience more in-depth
					than in a resume. Although I wrote every line of HTML, CSS, and

				<h2>Computer-Generated Images</h2>
				<p class="tabbedP">
					Visuals have always been an effective and fun way for me to learn,
					especially when the topic is abstract. The <a
						href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/tkinter.html"
					>tkinker</a>, <a
						href="https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/turtle.html?highlight=turtle"
					>turtle</a>, and <a href="https://python-pillow.org/">Pillow</a>
					Python GUI libraries allow for simple image manipulation, down to
					the pixel level.
				</p>

				<p class="tabbedP">For example, the left image below visualizes
					how numbers change after a given number of iterations in the
					unsolved Collatz conjecture; it has been my phone background for
					several years. For a more artistic visualization, see the right
					image below, which applies a smeared watercolor effect.</p>
				<div class="imgCollage">
					<div class="collageRow">
						<img
							class="collageCol"

						> <img
							class="collageCol"
							src="../Images/Projects/Python/CollatzWC2.bmp"
						>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p class="tabbedP">One can also visualize more useful and common
					mathematical ideas. The left image below shows how horizontal and
					vertical lines in the complex plane are transformed under e^(1/z).
					One can clearly see concentric cardioids. The right image below
					shows the graph of several common functions, like sine and the
					natural logarithm.</p>
				<div class="imgCollage">

						> <img
							class="collageCol"
							src="../Images/Projects/Python/pillowfunctions.bmp"
						>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p class="tabbedP">The Turtle library allows one to trace out
					colored paths in an image, like the rainbow spiral no the left
					below. Getting a little more advanced, one can create recursive
					shapes, like the Koch Snowflake, Serpinski Triangle, and dragon
					curve, shown below.</p>
				<div class="imgCollage">
					<div class="collageRow">
						<img
							class="collageCol"

						> <img
							class="collageCol"
							src="../Images/Projects/Python/dragonCurve-1.png"
						>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p class="tabbedP">One can also make other startlingly complex
					images from a simple set of recursive rules. The below images,
					known colleteively as "strange attractors," show a tree, Barnsley
					Fern, pine branch and piece of tall grass. The procedural
					generation techniques used to create these images, known as
					L-systems, are used in many of today's popular video games to make
					random, realistic terrain and plants.</p>

				<h2>Computer Vision Security Program</h2>
				<p class="tabbedP">This application started when my high-school
					engineering class had just moved into a larger building. It was
					common for expensive tools to get lost or stolen, so we needed a
					way to find these items and identify any culprits.</p>
				<p class="tabbedP">Although the new building already had some
					installed security cameras, there were still many blind spots, and
					footage could only be saved up to one week, meaning that if a tool
					were discovered missing after one week had passed, the traditional
					security cameras would not be useful in recovering it. My solution
					was to use Raspberry Pi's, which are small, cheap, and single-board
					computers, as "smart"" security cameras. These devices would be
					cheaper and easier to install than traditional cameras, and they
					could be more easily moved to another location if needed.</p>
				<p class="tabbedP">My first goal was to cut down on the storage
					space needed for footage without sacrificing picture quality or
					other valuable information. My solution was for the smart cameras
					to record video only when they detect motion. This way, disk space
					wouldn't be wasted on recording hours of the exact scene, but would
					still catch thieves as they walked into view.</p>
				<p class="tabbedP">
					This method worked extremely well. In many cases, hours of video
					was cut down to mere minutes. However, changing lighting conditions
					throughout the day could add noise to the image that would be
					mistaken for motion. I decided to fix this problem by having a
					threshold for motion that could be calibrated and changed
					automatically throughout the day. However, I wanted to make sure
					thieves would still be recorded, regardless of the lighting
					conditions. This is where computer vision came to my aid. Using
					Python's <a href="https://opencv.org">OpenCV</a> library, I
					searched the video feed for faces. If any faces were detected, a
					green rectangle would be drawn around the face in the video feed,
					an image of the frame containing the face would be saved, and the
					camera would wait to recalibrate until no faces were detected.
				</p>
				<p class="tabbedP">
					Taken from the camera's results is an image below of me walking
					through the frame, the camera has seen my face and is recording
					video. <img

				<h2>Automated Google Drive & Gmail</h2>
				<p class="tabbedP">This project is a continuation of the smart
					security camera. I wanted to use the Raspberry Pi's wireless
					internet capabilities to upload daily images and video to a Google
					Drive folder. I also wanted the cameras to provide daily email
					summaries of what they had seen and to alert the owner of any
					suspicious activity with attached evidence, like detecting a face
					after hours.</p>
				<p class="tabbedP">
					Using the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/PyDrive/">PyDrive</a>
					library, I was able to upload video and images to a specified
					GoogleDrive folder, like the one shown below. The movement of
					potential evidence of theft to cloud storage meant that the
					security camera didn't need more than a single day's storage
					capacity, as long as they had internet access. Further, evidence
					could less easily be tampered with or destroyed in a Google Drive
					folder as opposed to being stored locally on the camera. <img
						src="../Images/Projects/Python/driveUpload.png"
						style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"

				<p class="tabbedP">
					Using Python's <a

					>smptlib</a> and <a
						href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.html"
					>email</a> libraries, I was able to send basic summary emails with
					attached documents to any number of email addresses, as shown
					below. The security camera code could be modified to set times to
					send an email alert. The email portion of this project has
					application outside the smart security camera. It could be used
					similarly to other automated email services and could be triggered
					by almost any event. <img

				<h2>Multivariable Calculus Summary "Textbook"</h2>
				<p class="tabbedP">While taking a summer physics class dealing
					with Maxwell's Equations, which are written in the language of
					multivariable calculus, I realized how much of the subject I had
					forgotten, despite taking a multivariable calculus class (Calc III)
					only nine months earlier. I also knew that several of my friends
					who would be taking Calc III in the coming semester had already
					requested my advice about the class or to look at my handwritten
					notes, but I like to have my notes as a reference.</p>
				<p class="tabbedP">
					I decided to digitize my notes using <a
						href="https://www.latex-project.org/"
					>LaTeX</a> in a textbook structure: chapters with sections and
					sub-sections. I would also add better visual aids than my
					hurriedly-made sketches using images from textbooks and other
					online resources. This way, I could more easily share clear,
					legible notes, keep the original, and refresh my understanding in
					the process. By the time I was finished, I had condensed the
					several-thousand page textbook into an <a
						href="../Documents/Projects/MA242_Summary.pdf"
						target="_blank"
					>81-page guide</a> that still contained scores of visual aids and
					many full-length proofs. I feel much more confident in my
					abilities, and I think my friends will be able to learn from me
					much more easily.
