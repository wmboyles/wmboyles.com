  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <hr />
  <p>
    Hi, I'm William Boyles. I'm a <strong>computer science</strong> student at
    <strong>North Carolina State Univeristy</strong>, graduating in
    <strong>May 2022</strong> with a minor in mathematics. I'm originally from,
    Winston-Salem, North Carolina. When I'm not busy working on school projects,
    for classes like <strong>Software Engineering</strong>,
    <strong>Data Structures &amp; Algorithms</strong>, and
    <strong>Graph Theory</strong>, you might find me working on some of my own
    projects, like an app to predict air quality in Indian metro areas using
    <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Python 3</strong> or this website. If I'm
    not writing code, you might find me solving Rubik's Cubes, playing
    ping-pong, traveling with friends and family, or binging a comedy on
    Netflix.
  </p>
  <p>
    This past summer, I worked at <strong>IBM</strong> as a
    <strong>Cloud &amp; Cognitive Software Intern</strong>, where I used my
    <strong>Python 3</strong> skills to analyze and report cloud outage data
    using a Slack bot. I learned a lot about <strong>Docker</strong> and
    <strong>Kubernetes</strong> and eventaully deployed my work there. This
    summer, I'll be working at <strong>Microsoft</strong> as a
    <strong>Software Engineering Intern</strong>.
